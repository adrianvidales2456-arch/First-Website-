            I work at my Arvada Home Depot at customer service, I have been there for 6 months now. Due to that I have learned a lot of customer service skills, like improving my conversational skills and how to deal with difficult customers and figuring solutions to many different problems that I come across every single day. Also Due to this job I have learned how to work in a team and how to communicate with my coworkers to get the job done faster and more efficiently.

           My favorite genre of music is Rap and Rock always listening to artists like Juice Wrld,Kendrick Lamar, Linknin Park, The Offspring and many more.

            I also really enjoy learning about History, mainly World War 2 and Ancient Civilizations like the Romans, Greeks and Egyptians.

            I am not the biggest reader but I have been getting more and more into comic books and wanting to replicate that style of art in my own drawings and any type of art I do.
            <br>
            I have also been doing professional wrestling for 6 months, as I have always watched it and have always wanted to do it out of everything this pushes me out of my comfort zone the most as I am not the most athletic or at least I thought and it would be incredibly difficult as there is so much to learn and communicate about.
